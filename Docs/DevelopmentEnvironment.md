# Prepare Your Development Environment

To start coding together with me you need:

1. Cmake
2. C++ compiler or more
3. Ninja build tool
4. Your favourite IDE with CMAKE support or the preferable editor

The minimum CMake version 3.8 is required for this tutorial. Quickly grab [Cmake for your platform](https://cmake.org/download/) and install it. Download [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and plant it in your platform.  
Find a compiler that suit you:

* Linux, Android, IOS (a place for your documentation)
* Windows, you can use [Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [QT Creator](https://www.qt.io/qt-features-libraries-apis-tools-and-ide/) which provide CMake support and/or you can use [the MSYS2  software distro](https://www.msys2.org). Phew we are done.
