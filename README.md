# Cmaketopia

This project try to learn how to use CMAKE cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package your software from scratch. This repository contains the source code regarding topics discussed on [my blog](https://unclecshark.github.io/) on using CMAKE.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites to run the samples
- Install Cmake your prefered C++ compiler toolset and optionally with IDE supporting CMAKE project ( CMAKELists.txt file ) for your platform

For instance:
- Windows Platform ( MSVC, Mingw64, Clang ) optionally with IDE ( any Visual Studio 2017, QT Creator, VS Code will be OK ). Personally I utilize VS2017 Community , QT Creator, VS Code and MSVC, Mingw64 compilers.
- Linux, IOS, Android (here is a place for your part of the documentation)
