# Welcome to Cmaketopia
# First things first.
# Everyone can join us and become a member of our society.
## Introduction
Cmaketopia is a virtual state which is located in a beautiful mysterious country Cmakeland. The Cmaketopians, are the citizens of Cmaketopia. Cmaketopia is [the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) based on equality. Every Cmaketopian is equal. Every programming language is equal. Every platform is equal. Official languages: Cmake script, C, C++, C#, Python. Recognized language: English.<br>The Cmaketopians create an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer. The notion of borders is not unknown to them, but they don't care much about it. To exchange their ideas they use Github. They utilize CMAKE as cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
Although freedom is intrinsic part of their personality this community obey the laws of [Modern Cmake](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1) (do's and don'ts).<br>

This repository contains source code we create during our voyage to Cmakeland. I hope at the end of our trip we can say we love:<br>
[Cross-platform software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software)<br>
[DRY - Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)<br>
[KISS - keep it simple, stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)<br>

We hate:<br> [WET - Write Everything Twice, we enjoy typing, waste everyone's time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)<br>
No worries mate - suck it and see how simple and powerfull cmake is. I invite you on a trip [Down the bumpy road to Cmakeland](https://unclecshark.github.io/). [Seeya, speak to you soon](https://unclecshark.github.io/blog/).
