# Cmaketopia

The main purpose of this work is to interest and get you thinking about software building as another form of cross-platform programming. The software build process should be effective and portable and as much as possible separated from the target platform as well as used development tools. This project try to learn from scratch how to use CMAKE cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package your software. This repository contains the source code regarding topics discussed on [my blog](https://unclecshark.github.io/) on using CMAKE.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites to run the samples

* Install Cmake, your preferred C++ compiler toolset and optionally IDE supporting CMAKE project (
  CMAKELists.txt file ) for your platform.

For instance:

* Windows Platform ( MSVC, Mingw64, Clang ) optionally with IDE (any Visual Studio 2017, QT Creator, VS     Code will be OK). Personally I utilize VS2017 Community, QT Creator, VS Code and MSVC or Mingw64            compilers.
* Linux, IOS, Android (here is a place for your part of the documentation)
