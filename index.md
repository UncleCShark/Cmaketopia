# Hi everyone

First things first,
Everyone can join us and become a member of our society. Learning how to become a master of CMAKE takes time. It's a skill you learn as you go along. But remember even [a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step).

## Our diary

Rule number One - This tutorial is a constantly evolving document without a strict "release" date.  
Rule number Two - I hate [WET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) thus in this tutorial I use as many links to others as possible. If somebody writes something right, just use it and don't waste your time on typing. I invite you on a trip we are going uphill, working our way up though another level of corners.
Levels:

1. Introduction - [Short and sweet Fairytale](Docs/Introduction);
2. Prepare Your Development Environment - [On the bumpy road to Cmakeland](Docs/DevelopmentEnvironment.md);
3. Command line - [Highway to Hell for a tough guy](Docs/CommandLine.md).

[Seeya, speak to you soon. Please do visit my blog and leave a few words on it](https://unclecshark.github.io/).
