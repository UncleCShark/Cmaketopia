# Hi everyone

First things first,
Everyone can join us and become a member of our society. [A picture is worth a thousand words](Docs/Badge) - please see it, I'm sure you get the drift. Learning how to become a master of CMAKE takes time. It's a skill you learn as you go along. But remember even [a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step). The main purpose of this work is to interest and get you thinking about software building as another form of cross-platform programming. The software build process should be effective and portable and as much as possible separated from the target platform as well as used development tools.  

## Assumptions

- **This tutorial is a constantly evolving document without a strict "release" date;**
- **We hate [WET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) so if somebody describes something right, we use it.**  

Thus in this tutorial I use as many links to others as possible and don't waste my time on typing.  
A source code for this tutorial is [freely available](https://github.com/UncleCShark/Cmaketopia).
