# Hi everyone

First things first,
Everyone can join us and become a member of our society. Learning how to become a master of CMAKE takes time. It's a skill you learn as you go along. But remember even [a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step).

## Introduction

Cmaketopia is a virtual state which is located in a beautiful mysterious country Cmakeland. There are many beings in Cmakeland but some of them are Cmaketopians. The Cmaketopians, are the citizens of Cmaketopia. Cmaketopia is [the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) based on equality:  

- Every Cmaketopian is equal;
- Every programming language is equal;
- Every platform is equal.  

Official languages: Cmake script, C, C++, C#, Python.  
Recognized language: English.  

The Cmaketopians create an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer. The notion of borders is not unknown to them, but they don't care much about it. To exchange their ideas they use Github. They love abstract concepts. In their daily life they utilize CMAKE as cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
Although freedom is intrinsic part of their personality this community obey the laws of [Modern Cmake](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1) (do's and don'ts). If you want more theory about programming aspects [see below](#additional-reading-resources). If you can't read to the end, [come and kick the tires on this latest of the repository]({{ site.author.repository }}). It contains source code we create during our voyage to Cmakeland.  
I hope that at the end of our trip we can say we love:  

- [Cross-platform software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software)
- [DRY - Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- [KISS - keep it simple, stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- [WOCA - Write once, compile anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_compile_anywhere)
- [YAGNI - You aren't gonna need it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it),  

we hate:  

- [WET - Write Everything Twice, we enjoy typing, waste everyone's time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).  

"..You may say I'm a dreamer  

But I'm not the only one  

I hope some day you'll join us  

And the world will be as one..."  

No worries mate - suck it and see how the simple and powerfull tool CMAKE is.  

## Our diary

Rule number One - This tutorial is a constantly evolving document without a strict "release" date.  
Rule number Two - I hate [WET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) thus in this tutorial I use as many links to others as possible. If somebody writes something right, just use it and don't waste your time on typing. I invite you on a trip we are going uphill, working our way up though another level of corners.
Levels:

1. Prepare Your Development Environment - [On the bumpy road to Cmakeland](Docs/DevelopmentEnvironment.md);
2. Command line - [Highway to Hell for a tough guy](Docs/CommandLine.md)

[Seeya, speak to you soon. Please do visit my blog and leave a few words on it](https://unclecshark.github.io/).
